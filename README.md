# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

##Background
This week's lesson showed us how to use SQL the pull large amounts of data from specific data sources and analyze them. We look at this from the lens of a data analyst at a large
company with a lot of employee's heading into retirement. We then took the data analyzed it and put it into tables that could be easily interpreted. 

##Results 

- A majority of the employees of retiring age are Senior Staff/Engineers. This is going to cause a large vaccuum in which younger employees can be promoted. Shown in graph below:

- A large number of employees are ofg retiring age, so this 'silver tsunami' is a realistic issue that the manager should be planning for.
- Despite this, there are a large amount of employees at mentorship age. 
- Most of the employees at mentorship age also have senior titles.

##Summary

Looking at the Graph from the results section. There are about 70000 positions that would need to be filled as the 'silver tsunami' takes major effect. Fortunately there are 
enough mentors available to train the new employees.
